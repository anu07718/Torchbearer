# 📖 About

TorchBearer is a **Java-based Event Discovery and Management System** developed as a mini-project for the Department of Information Technology.

The platform aims to bridge the gap between **event organizers** and **travellers** by providing a centralized platform where organizers can publish events while travellers can easily discover, explore, and book them.

The application follows a **role-based architecture**, providing separate functionalities for Organizers and Travellers to ensure a seamless and personalized user experience.
